filière de baccalauréat, faire le choix d'une voie professionnelle, par une approche active autour de questionnaires d'intérêts.\\r\\n    Il s'agit de questionnaires d'investigation des intérêts conçus à partir du modèle de Holland.\\r\\n    Ils sont particulièrement adaptés dans le cadre d'un bilan d'orientation ou réorientation, évaluation des intérêts, choix de métier.\\r\\n    Ce test permet d'identifier des intérêts professionnels, voire de signaler une absence de maturation du projet.\\r\\n    Une synthèse des intérêts professionnels est délivrée en fin d'entretien.\\r\\n    L'élève peut visualiser la force de ses intérêts pour chaque type ainsi que les cohérences et incohérences inter domaines.\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <div *ngIf=\\\"showPackage==3\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>ORIENTATION</h4>\\r\\n    LYCÉE ET ENSEIGNEMENT SUPÉRIEUR\\r\\n    Il s'agit d'un programme d'aide à l'élaboration de projet d'études et professionnel. Les entretiens et questionnaires dont HEXA 3 D® ou les tests d’intérêts professionnels permettent au jeune d'exprimer ses goûts et ses centres d'intérêt par une approche de ses motivations. La présentation de profils de candidats, classés par centre d'intérêts sert de support au conseiller pour conduire l'entretien avec le jeune.\\r\\n    Son interprétation apporte des réponses individualisées et concrètes sur les filières, les métiers, les secteurs professionnels adaptés et contribue à construire une passerelle entre le projet professionnel, la réalité des études et la réussite.\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <div *ngIf=\\\"showPackage==4\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>ENTRETIEN CONSEILS</h4>\\r\\n    ACCOMPAGNEMENT ORIENTATION POST BAC\\r\\n    Pour décrypter les parcours possibles et choisir sa voie dans l’enseignement supérieur, les conseillers du CIDE proposent un accompagnement personnalisé aux lycéens ayant une idée précise de leur projet professionnel.\\r\\n    Les entretiens permettent d’identifier le projet du Lycéen et de\\r\\n    présenter filières, formations et débouchés professionnels afin de construire un parcours d’études supérieures cohérent.\\r\\n    Outre les conseils pratiques, l’objectif est de permettre aux lycéens de se projeter afin de faire des choix raisonnés et éclairés.\\r\\n    Si le lycéen est indécis sur sa poursuite d’études, un bilan d’orientation sera recommandé au préalable.\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <div *ngIf=\\\"showPackage==5\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>BILAN</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n    PSYCHOPEDAGOGIQUE COMPLET\\r\\n    \\r\\n    La démarche du CIDE est d'intégrer toutes les données pédagogiques, psychologiques et affectives mises en évidence par les différents tests proposés, afin de révéler le maximum des facettes de la personnalité et des compétences des jeunes qui nous sont confiés.\\r\\n    Le bilan psycho-pédagogique proposé par le CIDE se déroule sous forme :\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li>d'entretiens cliniques,</li>\\r\\n      <li>de tests psychométriques</li>\\r\\n      <li>de questionnaires d'intérêts et de motivation aboutissant à l'établissement d'un profil d'intérêt.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    Les tests proposés par le CIDE sont objectivables, fiables, validés et reconnus par la communauté scientifique.\\r\\n    Seul un psychologue-clinicien dûment expérimenté est à même de conduire un bilan psychopédagogique tel qu'il se pratique au CIDE.\\r\\n    Les tests psychométriques que nous utilisons (WISC® et WAIS®)\\r\\n    ont pour but, entre autre, d'explorer le fonctionnement cognitif du jeune.\\r\\n    Il s'agit de tests dits \\\"d'intelligence\\\" (tests de QI), permettant\\r\\n    de déterminer le quotient intellectuel du jeune et de le situer par rapport à une population échantillonnée.\\r\\n    En ce qui concerne les tests de QI il convient de préciser que l'intelligence fonctionne par secteurs. Il en ressort que ces tests permettent de déterminer comment le jeune se situe à un moment donné, dans un secteur donné.\\r\\n    L'équipe du CIDE a fait le choix de travailler sur la toute nouvelle version du WISC® afin de s'appuyer sur les toutes dernières théories du développement cognitif et en particulier \\\"l'indice de raisonnement fluide\\\".\\r\\n    Ces tests restent des outils et en aucune façon ne doivent \\\"figer\\\" le jeune dans une évaluation. L'intelligence est multiple et ces tests n'en mesurent que certains des aspects.\\r\\n    C'est pour cela que la rencontre et les échanges entre le clinicien et le jeune sont aussi importants. La passation du bilan complet nécessite donc plusieurs entretiens. La restitution des résultats se fait avec les parents.\\r\\n    Un rapport complet individualisé est remis à l'issue de cette série d'entretiens.\\r\\n    Parmi les questionnaires d'intérêt et de motivation nous avons fait\\r\\n    le choix de HEXA 3 D®. Il s'agit d'un questionnaire d'investigation des intérêts conçu à partir du modèle de Holland qui permet d'aborder les représentations des sujets à travers trois domaines :\\r\\n    activités préférées, qualités et professions.\\r\\n    En résumé le Bilan Psychopédagogique est particulièrement recommandé pour comprendre le mode de fonctionnement intellectuel du jeune et déterminer son QI, déceler et comprendre la nature de possibles conflits psycho-affectifs et les voies pour y remédier, proposer des orientations adaptées.\\r\\n    Bien entendu le CIDE peut dans certains cas spécifiques proposer un suivi personnalisé.\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n</div>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n//

et affectives mises en évidence par les différents tests proposés, afin de révéler le maximum des facettes de la personnalité et des compétences des jeunes qui nous sont confiés.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLe bilan psycho-pédagogique proposé par le CIDE se déroule sous forme :\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>d'entretiens cliniques,</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>de tests psychométriques</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>de questionnaires d'intérêts et de motivation aboutissant à l'établissement d'un profil d'intérêt.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLes tests proposés par le CIDE sont objectivables, fiables, validés et reconnus par la communauté scientifique.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSeul un psychologue-clinicien dûment expérimenté est à même de conduire un bilan psychopédagogique tel qu'il se pratique au CIDE.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLes tests psychométriques que nous utilisons (WISC® et WAIS®)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tont pour but, entre autre, d'explorer le fonctionnement cognitif du jeune.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIl s'agit de tests dits \\\"d'intelligence\\\" (tests de QI), permettant\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tde déterminer le quotient intellectuel du jeune et de le situer par rapport à une population échantillonnée.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEn ce qui concerne les tests de QI il convient de préciser que l'intelligence fonctionne par secteurs. Il en ressort que ces tests permettent de déterminer comment le jeune se situe à un moment donné, dans un secteur donné.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tL'équipe du CIDE a fait le choix de travailler sur la toute nouvelle version du WISC® afin de s'appuyer sur les toutes dernières théories du développement cognitif et en particulier \\\"l'indice de raisonnement fluide\\\".\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCes tests restent des outils et en aucune façon ne doivent \\\"figer\\\" le jeune dans une évaluation. L'intelligence est multiple et ces tests n'en mesurent que certains des aspects.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tC'est pour cela que la rencontre et les échanges entre le clinicien et le jeune sont aussi importants. La passation du bilan complet nécessite donc plusieurs entretiens. La restitution des résultats se fait avec les parents.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUn rapport complet individualisé est remis à l'issue de cette série d'entretiens.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParmi les questionnaires d'intérêt et de motivation nous avons fait\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tle choix de HEXA 3 D®. Il s'agit d'un questionnaire d'investigation des intérêts conçu à partir du modèle de Holland qui permet d'aborder les représentations des sujets à travers trois domaines :\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactivités préférées, qualités et professions.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEn résumé le Bilan Psychopédagogique est particulièrement recommandé pour comprendre le mode de fonctionnement intellectuel du jeune et déterminer son QI, déceler et comprendre la nature de possibles conflits psycho-affectifs et les voies pour y remédier, proposer des orientations adaptées.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBien entendu le CIDE peut dans certains cas spécifiques proposer un suivi personnalisé.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"javascript:void(0);\\\" class=\\\"customClosePopUp\\\">X</a>\\r\\n\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n

             PSYCHOPEDAGOGIQUE COMPLET\\r\\n\\r\\n                  La démarche du CIDE est d'intégrer toutes les données pédagogiques, psychologiques et affectives mises en évidence par les différents tests proposés, afin de révéler le maximum des facettes de la personnalité et des compétences des jeunes qui nous sont confiés.\\r\\n                  Le bilan psycho-pédagogique proposé par le CIDE se déroule sous forme :\\r\\n                  <ul>\\r\\n                      <li>d'entretiens cliniques,</li>\\r\\n                      <li>de tests psychométriques</li>\\r\\n                      <li>de questionnaires d'intérêts et de motivation aboutissant à l'établissement d'un profil d'intérêt.</li>\\r\\n                  </ul>\\r\\n                  Les tests proposés par le CIDE sont objectivables, fiables, validés et reconnus par la communauté scientifique.\\r\\n                  Seul un psychologue-clinicien dûment expérimenté est à même de conduire un bilan psychopédagogique tel qu'il se pratique au CIDE.\\r\\n                  Les tests psychométriques que nous utilisons (WISC® et WAIS®)\\r\\n                  ont pour but, entre autre, d'explorer le fonctionnement cognitif du jeune.\\r\\n                  Il s'agit de tests dits \\\"d'intelligence\\\" (tests de QI), permettant\\r\\n                  de déterminer le quotient intellectuel du jeune et de le situer par rapport à une population échantillonnée.\\r\\n                  En ce qui concerne les tests de QI il convient de préciser que l'intelligence fonctionne par secteurs. Il en ressort que ces tests permettent de déterminer comment le jeune se situe à un moment donné, dans un secteur donné.\\r\\n                  L'équipe du CIDE a fait le choix de travailler sur la toute nouvelle version du WISC® afin de s'appuyer sur les toutes dernières théories du développement cognitif et en particulier \\\"l'indice de raisonnement fluide\\\".\\r\\n                  Ces tests restent des outils et en aucune façon ne doivent \\\"figer\\\" le jeune dans une évaluation. L'intelligence est multiple et ces tests n'en mesurent que certains des aspects.\\r\\n                  C'est pour cela que la rencontre et les échanges entre le clinicien et le jeune sont aussi importants. La passation du bilan complet nécessite donc plusieurs entretiens. La restitution des résultats se fait avec les parents.\\r\\n                  Un rapport complet individualisé est remis à l'issue de cette série d'entretiens.\\r\\n                  Parmi les questionnaires d'intérêt et de motivation nous avons fait\\r\\n                  le choix de HEXA 3 D®. Il s'agit d'un questionnaire d'investigation des intérêts conçu à partir du modèle de Holland qui permet d'aborder les représentations des sujets à travers trois domaines :\\r\\n                  activités préférées, qualités et professions.\\r\\n                  En résumé le Bilan Psychopédagogique est particulièrement recommandé pour comprendre le mode de fonctionnement intellectuel du jeune et déterminer son QI, déceler et comprendre la nature de possibles conflits psycho-affectifs et les voies pour y remédier, proposer des orientations adaptées.\\r\\n                  Bien entendu le CIDE peut dans certains cas spécifiques proposer un suivi personnalisé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                  <div class=\\\"conseil-price\\\">590<sup>€</sup></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n                  <a

La saison 11 de Secret Story promet de nombreuses surprises.</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\\"lead\\\"><strong>[Mis à jour le 19 juillet&nbsp;2017 à 23h46] </strong>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Avis aux passionnés de <a href=\\\"http://www.linternaute.com/television/programme/1258029-secret-story-11-quelle-date-de-diffusion-pour-la-nouvelle-saison/\\\">Secret Story</a>,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   la saison 11 commencera prochainement sur TF1 et NT1 et compte son lot de surprises. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   La conférence de presse organisée à la Tour <a href=\\\"http://www.linternaute.com/television/programme-tf1/\\\">TF1</a> ce mercredi 19 juillet a dévoilé plusieurs nouveautés. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   Christophe Beaugrand, l'animateur de l'émission sur NT, avait d'ores et déjà annoné que le casting avait démarré en mai dernier. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\\"La saison 11&nbsp;de Secret Story se prépare. Si vous voulez devenir candidat cette année, \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   c'est tout simple&nbsp;: il vous suffit de vous inscrire sur la page casting de MyTF1.\\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Ce 19 juillet,&nbsp;pour faire patienter les fans avant le lancement officiel, la production de l'émission a dévoilé lors d'une conférence de presse plusieurs&nbsp;nouveautés. Si les règles du jeu restent les mêmes, la Maison des secrets a été complètement métamorphosée ! \\\"On m'a dit que je n'allais pas reconnaître la maison\\\", s'est exclamé Julien Geloën, gagnant de Secret Story 10 et nouveau chroniqueur dans \\\"Debrief\\\" avec Christophe Beaugrand (il remplace&nbsp;Julie Taton). La chroniqueuse Leila Ben Khalifa est toujours présente parmi les chroniqueurs pour la troisième année consécutive.&nbsp;La Saison 11 de Secret Story se déroulera&nbsp;sur le thème du Campus. \\\"La Maison se transforme en Campus des secrets\\\", a annoncé la Voix, sans en dévoiler davantage.&nbsp;Christophe Beaugrand a quant à lui donné un peu plus de détails au site melty.fr : \\\"De nouveaux profils vont nous rejoindre dans le Debrief, ce sera un véritable talk-show en direct... On prendra plus notre temps pour discuter du programme. Le conducteur de l'émission va être allégé, tout va être repensé\\\", a-t-il déclaré.&nbsp;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>La chaîne avait annoncé il y a quelques semaines la date à laquelle démarrerait Secret&nbsp;Story 11. <strong>Le 4 septembre prochain, <a href=\\\"http://www.linternaute.com/television/programme-nt1/\\\">NT1</a> donnera le coup d'envoi à cette nouvelle saison</strong> et&nbsp;proposera de découvrir les différents candidats et leurs petits secrets, que l'on espère étonnants. L'annonce officielle de NT1 explique aux potentiels candidats : \\\"Si vous avez un secret et pensez être de taille à le défendre, ne perdez pas une minute.&nbsp;Il ne reste que quelques semaines pour tenter votre chance.\\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</article>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div><!-- .col-* -->\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t</div><!-- .row -->\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t</div><!-- .container
